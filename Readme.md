This is a small game to play and learn the Q algorithm.

I followed this Blogpost. Take a look for further informations:

## Usage

Play by yourself, as human ;)

```bash
ruby run.rb
```

Run the game with a player who used the Q-Learning-Algorithm

```bash
ruby run.rb --player=QPlayer
``` 

For more options run:

```bash
ruby run.rb -h
```
